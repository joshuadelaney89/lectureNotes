            <h3>Padding</h3>
            <p>Remember that padding is inside the margins and border. You can set the padding for divs, h's, p's, etc., but you will be inside the margins</p>

            <h4>Padding</h4>
            <p id="padding-experiment">Here is a bunch of text to mess around with. Mack like you don't remember the cash and the money
                The mad dash after the ball had dropped
                Dolphin turned tail on you right then and the water was hot
                Boiling oil, separating all the good stuff to the top
                And then the bottom fell out and the bodies hit the flo'
                Same old, bare face and body while you come pay-rollin'
                Everybody rockin' that halo back in the day, but they know, say no mo'
                The ghost of bitches and chickens come home to roost
                And every stitch that was put in this hitch got thread that's connected to the truth
                And demons seekin' freedom out here weavin' the quilt
                And there may even be some meaning gleamin' in the streets that they built</p>
